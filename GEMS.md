# Using Gems
If you'd like to use the gem feature (basically mini-templates that can be re-used) provided by [Emerald Templates](https://github.com//L1lith/Emerald-Templates), I'd suggest installing Emerald Templates globally

```
npm install -g emerald-templates
```

You can use a gem by running this command inside your project directory:

```
emt gem {gemName}
```

You can list the available gems like this:
```
emt gems
```

## Translate
in order to translate your `pages-src` folder into your pages run the translate gem
```
emt gem translate
```
